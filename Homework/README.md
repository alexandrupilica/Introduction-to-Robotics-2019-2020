Lab Homeworks: 
  
  analogRGBControl - Using 3 Potentiometers, we can fully control the colors of an RGB LED
  
  knockDetector - Using a passive buzzer, we can detect a knock which triggers an active buzzer that plays a sound 5 seconds after the knock, a sound which we can turn off with a push button (this is what it's supposed to do, but mine doesn't quite do that)
  
  4digit7segment-counter - Using a 4 digit 7-segment display, we can control each individual digit with the help of a joystick
